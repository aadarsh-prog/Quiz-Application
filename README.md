I have developed a Quiz Creation Web Application that allows users to create quizzes and share the URL with others to take the quiz. The application offers a seamless process for quiz creation and participation. Here's a brief overview of the project:

Frontend:
HTML & CSS: I used HTML for structuring the content of the web pages, and CSS for designing and styling the application, making it visually appealing and responsive.
JavaScript: It handles client-side interactions such as dynamically adding questions and options during quiz creation. Additionally, it controls the behavior of forms and ensures that input fields work interactively without needing to refresh the page.
Backend:
JSP (JavaServer Pages) and Servlets: JSPs are used to create the dynamic web pages, while Servlets manage the core backend logic. The Servlets handle user input, manage session data, and interact with the database.
MySQL: MySQL is used for storing quiz data, user details, and responses. The application connects to the database via JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to perform CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) on quiz and user data.
